## Using these materials

The materials below are provided particularly in hopes that they might help others
to recreate some or all of the techniques practiced at the Minnesota Supercomputing
Institute to manage systems with [Puppet](https://puppet.com/).

Codes and configuration files tend to be unaltered from those in use at MSI, and in
some cases we refer you to the living canonical repository that MSI builds against.
As a result, some materials include MSI names and nomenclature that render them 
unsuitable for direct copy/paste usage. We believe they are still valuable
references to readers with detailed questions, and as examples for operators creating
similar deployments.
